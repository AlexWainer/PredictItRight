# PredictItRight
## Supervised machine learning models used for a variety of problems. 

### Overview
This repository contains my code to a supervised learning assignment for university. The assignment involves three distinct predictive modeling tasks using various machine learning techniques.

### Assignment Questions
Question 1: Predicting Quality of Mealies
Objective: Predict the quality of mealies using a Random Forest model.
Approach:
Data preprocessing and feature selection.
Training a Random Forest model and peforming cross validation.
Evaluating the model's performance using appropriate metrics.

Question 2: Predicting Cricket Match Outcome
Objective: Predict if the defending team in cricket will win their match using a Logistic Regression model.
Approach:
Data preprocessing and feature engineering.
Training multiple Logistic Regression models using different regularization methods.
Evaluating the model's accuracy and other performance metrics.

Question 3: Predicting UPDRS
Objective: Predict the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) using Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Gradient Boosted models, then decide which model to use.
Approach:
Data preprocessing and normalization.
Training three different models: Random Forest, KNN, and Gradient Boosting.
Comparing the models based on performance metrics.
Selecting the best model for the final prediction.

### Results
Question 1: Model performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score for predicting the quality of mealies.
Question 2: Model accuracy and other relevant metrics for predicting cricket match outcomes.
Question 3: Comparison of Random Forest, KNN, and Gradient Boosting models for UPDRS prediction, with a final recommendation based on performance.
